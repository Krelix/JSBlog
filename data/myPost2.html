<p>5 years as an iOS developer has pushed me to understand and improve my product/physical/functional design skills. Especially “industrial” design – problems and solutions.</p>
<p>Here’s a great one I saw the other day: combining a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart">Snellen Chart</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_sight_distance">Stopping Distances</a>, i.e.:</p>

<h3>Existing (bad) solutions</h3>
<p>The status quo on driving “too close for safety” is provocative, antagonistic. Have a look at a search for <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_kw=IF+YOU+CAN+READ+THIS+YOU%27RE+TOO+CLOSE+Window+Decal+Bumper+Sticker+Auto+Car+Truck">eBay: “too close bumper sticker”</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://t-machine.org/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-04-26-at-15.57.35.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-26 at 15.57.35" width="184" height="136" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3245"></p>
<p>There’s a couple of major problems with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s wrong. If you’re stationary, 6 feet behind the vehicle, you can read it – but you’re definitely NOT too close.
</li><li>It’s combative and offensive. It appeals to the anger and frustration of the driver in front – when we’re trying to modify the behaviour of the driver behind. Offending people who you’re trying to convince to change … is generally unsuccessful.
</li></ol>
<p>But combining the charts above, we get…</p>
<h3>Net result</h3>
<p>A plate you attach to your vehicle that informs the viewer how much too close/far they are right now, using a dynamic scale:</p>
<p><img src="http://t-machine.org/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-04-26-at-15.26.36.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-26 at 15.26.36" width="567" height="517" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3244"></p>
<p>I couldn’t get a close enough photo to show it clearly, so here’s my redrawing of what the plate looked like:</p>
